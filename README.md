Wanting to gain more knowledge about MongoDB, I subscribed to a MongoDB University course, [M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/MongoDB/M101J/2017_March/syllabus), upon finalizing this receiving a [completion certification](http://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/c30fd403-0742-43ae-83d6-138834ff):

I decided to share what I've learned (or at least a small part of what I've learned) and thus created [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SLUWvZsgZr9ZBch_FdFzkvnMqUjFKo0rpiEEKNtLftQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Hope it will help you kick-start your work with MongoDB!
